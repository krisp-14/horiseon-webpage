# code-refactor-1

## Description

In this code refactor challenge, I'm going to be modifying a website for a marketing agency so that their codebase follows accessibility standards.
I'm using this challenge to become familiar with:
- Semantic HTML elements
- 'alt' attributes contained in image and icon elements
- Heading attributes
- Title elements

## Installation

To install this project, there was a starter code provided by the marketing agency for me to review and refactor.

## Usage

A mock-up was provided to show the web application's appearance and functionality.
